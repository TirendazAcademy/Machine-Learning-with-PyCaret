[*PyCaret*](https://pycaret.org/) is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates machine learning workflows. PyCaret empowers anyone to build low-code, powerful, end-to-end machine learning solutions.

PyCaret is a low-code library that can be used to replace hundreds of lines of code with just a few lines. This allows you to perform machine learning projects quickly and efficiently. It is basically a Python wrapper surrounding various machine learning libraries and frameworks like scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, spaCy, Optuna, Hyperopt, Ray, and a few more.

You can install PyCaret with Python's pip package manager: `pip install pycaret`

This repository contains PyCaret tutorials with the notebooks and datasets.
